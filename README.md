# Crafting Interpreters
This project repo is to follow along  Robert Nystrom's crafting interpreters book: https://craftinginterpreters.com/

There are essentially two main parts of the book: 
* The first part builds an interpreter, Lox, in Java. This is to help introduce concepts <br>
* The second part rebuilds the same interpreter in C. This is to show how the implementation really works


Instead of building the first part in Java, I decided to follow along and build it in C++. This is located in the folder cpplox.


## Progress Update
Here I will mark how far along in the book I currently am. Will try to keep this updated with each commit, or at the very least major milestones.

#### Currently on Chapter 5
